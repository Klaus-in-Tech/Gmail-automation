This project aims to automate the process of sending emails using UiPath, a powerful Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool. By automating email communication, you can save time and ensure accurate and consistent messaging.

### Features

- UiPath Studio installed on your machine.
- A valid email account from which you want to send the emails.
- Access to an SMTP server to send the emails (e.g., Gmail SMTP).

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the UiPath Studio and load the "Email_Automation.xaml" workflow.

5. Customize the email content template as per your requirements.

6. Save the changes and execute the workflow.

### How It Works

1. The automation will read the Google sheet for the email details and the Google Doc for the email template.

2. For each recipient, it will send a personalized email using the email template.

### Note

- This automation is for educational purposes and may require modifications to suit your specific use case.
- Ensure you have permission to send emails from the specified email account to avoid any legal issues.
